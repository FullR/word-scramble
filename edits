6. Insert a ‘shuffle’ button in the choice box.
I like that if I’m stuck and want to look at the letters differently,
so I don’t have to individually move them each time.

  Done

7. Once the letters are put in the upper slots,
could we make it so if one were to double click it,
it would move back down to the unused letter spaces?

  done
  I also made it so double clicking the lower slots (with letters in them) will place the letter in the first empty upper slot
  And pressing a letter key on the keyboard will move that letter (if it exists) from the bottom to the first open space on the top
